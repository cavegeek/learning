To start with, I got cargo and used it to set up a binary project.
It creates the project with a certain layout, but it's tidy.
It also creates a dependency tracking file, a nice touch!

Using vim compiler settings from
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim/tree/master/compiler

rustdoc doesn't show documentation of things in main.rs.

Choosing combine for parsing, it looks more readable than nom.
But it seems to have problems using a parser twice.
The examples don't do this!
It can be solved by returning a new parser from a unit function each use.
Lambdas capture and thus behave differently from functions.
